For the mm^3 EM data set and the functional data from Baylor

(...maybe CT later ?)

tools for:
- handling data from Baylor and Fiji Image stacks
- performing a 3D alignment solve between landmarks
- transforming points based on a 3D solve result
- create neuroglancer links for checking visualization on the BOSS
